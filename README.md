This repository contains code examples written for the series of articles “[Unit Testing Vue.js Components with the Official Vue Testing Tools and Jest](https://leanpub.com/testingvuejscomponentswithjest)” by [Alex Jover](https://alexjoverm.github.io/about/).

## Getting started

We assume you're already familiar with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework and a concept of [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).

You might also want to have a look at the testing tools that we're going to use in this series: [vue-test-utils](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils) (an official test library for Vue.js) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) (testing framework developed by Facebook).

### Preparing and running tests

To run the code from this repository and build the application use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:alexjoverm/vue-testing-series.git

# change the folder
cd vue-testing-series

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# run tests once
npm t

# run tests in watch mode to monitor what breaks as you change the code
npm t -- --watch
```

### Build Setup

```bash
# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For the detailed explanation of how things work, check out the [Vue.js Templates guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
